📘 AI-ML Labs

A collection of my AI and Machine Learning learning labs — including Jupyter notebooks, notes from books and courses, and hands-on experiments.

This repo documents my progress as I explore Python foundations, data analysis, and deep learning fundamentals. Here, each folder corresponds to a different source.

🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This repository serves as my personal lab environment for:
- Practicing Python for data analysis
- Building intuition for NumPy, Pandas, and visualization
- Taking structured notes from books and courses
- Running hands-on experiments to deepen ML/DL understanding
- Documenting my progress toward becoming an AI/LLM engineer

🚀 Current Focus
- Completing the DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization
- Strengthening fundamentals (NumPy, Pandas, data workflows)
- Preparing for more advanced LLM and MLOps engineering work

🔮 Upcoming Additions

- Transformer fundamentals (Hugging Face course)
- LLM engineering experiments (RAG, embeddings, agents)
- MLOps workflows and model deployment labs
- PyTorch practice notebooks
